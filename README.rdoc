= RubyQuad

== About

I am purely doing this to learn the ruby vm and language 'the hard way' so to speak. A QuadTree is a straight forward and efficient data structure for storing and querying on spatial information. A common example of using this code might bt to create a map with lat lng points then creating bounding box queries to find the points within a specific region.
